# scripting-boilerplate

I want to establish a working pattern that we can use js/ts to quickly explore data, execute snippets, persist output and adjust code quickly. And of course, to stablize this pattern via code.

I want to make it so easy that writing some working code with working test and persisting it no longer looks scary, where you are forced to setup a repo and many basic things.
